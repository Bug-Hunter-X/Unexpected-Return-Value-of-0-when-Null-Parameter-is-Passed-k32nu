This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a potential bug where a function returns 0 unexpectedly when one of its parameters is null. The bug is in the `foo` function which does not handle null values appropriately and simply returns 0 if either parameter `a` or `b` is null.  The `bug.js` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected version that handles the null value properly.  The solution checks if both parameters are null before performing the addition; otherwise, it proceeds with the addition.  This ensures the function behaves as expected even when null parameters are passed.
